## ‚ùì Adding Alerts for New PowerSchool Fields

1. Firstly, make sure you have a boolean field that can be used to control if the alert is shown or not, something like, `U_ALERTS.Test_Alert` that can take a `0` or a `1` as a value.
2. Next, create a file in `web_root/admin/alerts` with the title of your alert .html, e.g. `testAlert.html`. 
3. Copy the code below into your `testAlert.html`

```html
<div class="box-round" id="alert-~(studentfrn)">
	<img class="alertImage" src="/images/isa_alert.youralertimage.png" width="20px" />
	<div class="alertContent">
		<h2 tabindex="0">
			Test Alert
		</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			Either some pre-set text, <br>
            or a value from a PowerSchool Field, e.g. ~(U_ALERTS.Test_Alert_Text)
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
```
4. You can also now create a custom alert icon, like the ones displayed above with dimensions of `20px x 20px` that can be linked into the alert, replacing `/images/isa_alert.youralertimage.png` with the relative link to your image.
5. Now, to have the alert display on the student page in PowerSchool Admin, edit `web_root/wildcards/isa_alerts.txt`. And copy the following code to the top of the file, (or between the alerts where you want the new alert to show up).

```html
~([students.U_ALERTS]Test_Alert;if.fieldvalue.0.then=;if.fieldvalue.1.then=
<a title="Your Alert Title" href="/admin/alerts/testAlert.html?frn=~(frn)" class="dialogM">
    <img src="/images/isa_alert.youralertimage.png" border=0 width="20" height="20" title="Your Alert Title"/>
</a>)
```

6. That is all that has to be done for an admin only alert. To add an alert for the teacher side of PowerSchool the following steps have to be done.
7. Make a copy of your `testAlert.html` and place it in `web_root/teachers/alerts`.
8. Next, open up `web_root/wildcards/isa_alerts_teachers.txt` and add the following code.

```html
~([students.U_ALERTS]Test_Alert;if.fieldvalue.0.then=;if.fieldvalue.1.then=
<a title="Your Alert Title" href="/teachers/alerts/testAlert.html?frn=~(frn)" class="dialogM">
    <img src="/images/isa_alert.youralertimage.png" border=0 width="20" height="20" title="Your Alert Title"/>
</a>)
```

9. Now your alert will show up on the student screens, however to add it to the attendance screen, a few more steps have to be done.
10. Open up the file, `\web_root\teachers\classattendance.isa_alerts.content.footer.txt` & copy the following code, editing the `variable name`, `table name` & `field name` to match those for your custom alert. Paste this editied code below the last SQL query in the file, and before `// Function Step 2`.

```sql
var testAlertRows (<- change me) = {
        ~[tlist_sql;
        select cc.id, s.dcid
        from cc cc
        join students s on s.id = cc.studentid
    left outer join u_alerts ( <- change me) on u_sds.studentsdcid = s.dcid
        where cc.sectionid = ~(gpv.sectionid;sqlText)
            and to_date('~(gpv.att_date;sqlText)','~[datetext:mmddyyyy]') between cc.dateenrolled and cc.dateleft-1
        and u_alerts.test_alert (<- change me) = 1 
        ]"~(1)":"~(2)",[/tlist_sql]"":""

};
```

11. Now the final step is to copy the code below, again changing the alert `<a />` to match the one from the `isa_alerts_teachers.txt`, replacing the `frn=~(frn)` with `frn=001'+ studcid +'`

```js
$j.each(carePlanRows, function(ccid, studcid) {
    $j('tr[id=ccid_' + ccid + '] td:eq(1)').append('<a style="padding-right:5px;" title="Test Alert" href="/teachers/alerts/testAlert.html?frn=001'+ studcid +'" class="dialogM"><img src="/images/isa_alert.youralertimage.png" border=0 width="20" height="20" title="Test Alert"/></a>');
});
```
12. Now paste this below the comment `// Function Step 2` and if all goes well, you can upload the plugin, enable it, log into PowerTeacher and see your new alert for all the students that have that value set to `1`!

## üè• Medical Page
* This plugin makes major changes to make the default PowerSchool `Medical / Emergency Page` more useful. It also adds in checkbox's and links for ISA's SDS custom fields which, in turn, are used to render the alerts.
* Below is a help sheet for each of the fields used in the medical page, <i>(I kept forgetting which was which)</i>
